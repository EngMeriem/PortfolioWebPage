Welcome to your second checkpoint, and congratulation for making it this far.

Time to practice what we’ve learned.  You will be creating a portfolio web page. You will find an example in the link below and it will recreate the structure using HTML.

At this checkpoint, you’re instructed to:

    Use Semantic Tags.
    Add a video/audio to the web page.
    Use local links, lists, or tables.
    Use HTML forms.

Here's an example to use as a guideline (keep in mind not to replicate it entirely. Try to be creative.)
